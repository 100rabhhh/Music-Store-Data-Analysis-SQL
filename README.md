    <h1>🎵 Music Store Data Analysis using SQL</h1>
    <p>
        This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive music store dataset, containing 12 CSV files that were exported to PostgreSQL for deeper insights. The dataset includes key entities like albums, artists, customers, invoices, tracks, and more. Through SQL queries, I performed an analysis to answer 11 critical business questions that highlight trends in customer spending, music genre popularity, regional sales, and artist performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The analysis helped in identifying customer behaviors, preferred music genres, top-performing artists, and regions that contribute the most to the company’s revenue. Additionally, by examining invoice and track data, insights on high-value sales and long-play tracks were uncovered. The findings offer actionable insights for the music store's business strategy, helping them to optimize marketing efforts and improve customer engagement.
